### **To Do List**
1. Complete CB Competitive Programming Lectures & [**Graph Theory.**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2q4fbVm1Ik6DCzm9XZJbNwyHtHGclcEh) (Going on)
2. Complete CB Dynamic Programming Lectures.
3. Work on generating layouts for analog designs using ALIGN & with OSU180 PDK. (Urgent)
4. Compete in Codeforces Live Contests ASAP (Difficult but I have to do). 
5. Preparation. (Urgent) (Going on)
6. How to work for "OpenRoad" Development? (Routing/STA Engine).
7. Shell Scripting [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIYmaxcEqw5JhK3b-6rgdWO_). 
8. Write on Medium about "PG: When to pursue".
9. [CP Template](https://pastebin.com/jVURaNCJ)
10. Compete in CodeForces Div 3 Contest ASAP.
11. [**ITMO CP course**](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/2) (Probably the best free competitive programming course on the planet. Pashka is just phenomenal )
12. [**Coursera VLSI CAD Course**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/vlsi-cad-layout/supplement/Ytgkc/week-1-overview) (I figured this out recently. This is the best VLSI CAD course out there that is available for free. Man, these guys have Placement and Routing Visualisers etc. It's always been my dream to do work at this level.)
13. A project on Routing and Timing. (Tool Design and Development).
14. Solving problems on Binary Search. (It's very rewarding. I got to know a lot of concepts by solving problems).
------------------------
### **Progress Tracking**
1. Bit Masking (Completed).
2. Math (Big Integers) (Going On).
3. I am unable to design a placement engine despite doing a complete course on it. I will have to investigate further. I need some help here from CAD researchers/CS Engineers.
4. VLSI CAD Course. (Completed)
5. Linked List Coding Problems on Binary Search. (Going On).
------------------------
### **Observations**
1. Computer Science not only teaches you tech, it teaches you life.
2. The Universe is extremely non-linear. (80/20 Principle).
3. Entrance Coaching not only prepares for exams but hardens you. It improves your rigour in the subject matter.
4. Everybody runs after money, but nobody acknowledges it.
5. If you don't ask, the answer is always "No".
6. "20's" is all about figuring out what you want to do for the rest of your life.
7. Physical Design (Specifically P&R has little to no math required. All the math is present in PDN, STA, EDA, Analog Design, Memory Design, Architecture R&D). Also, people seem to solve **Bounded** problems in Physical Design.
8. ABK believes that performing experimental investigations is much more important than Algorithms. As a guy from a Pure Math & CS background, he can say that. I have not quite explored Algorithms area yet. I believe that EDA has more precedence and is tougher when compared to Physical Design. I found some really smart people who are in EDA.
9. The best and the most optimal way to approach EDA is through the Pure Math and Computer Science route rather than the Electrical Engineering Route. Eg. ABK, Thens etc.



------------------------
### **Much Later**
1. Know about some analog designs from Sheryl.
2. Know about PLL design.
3. Python for Quant Finance Lecture on Udemy.
4. [**JEE Math Lectures**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQUwyeyCbReMBmABf-Q-XqG40oB5KrDQoUlLMpDZhBu18YasgWI72pAyH4beYolw95ylxQJdPqSWcig/pubhtml#) & [**Vedantu Math Lectures**](https://www.youtube.com/c/VedantuMath/playlists) & Some IMO problems.
5. [**Habits**](https://www.habitstrong.com/)
6. Policy Based Data Structures
7. Template for Competitive Programming from Coding Blocks.
-----------------------
### **Much Much Later (Probably after 1 year)**
1. Design related ideas. Interior Design. Design of Machines. Design in General.
2. Drawing.
3. [**Surviving IIM-A.**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIO8daZRc7DcLyv5ptsJwU-aqnZc0Tznt)
4. [**Consulting Cases**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIO8daZRc7Dfu0GloK0HJbU2k6v1wNoDX) & [**Example Cases.**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIO8daZRc7DdLTW-PK4tpQpePP3ee-TkD)
5. [**Cases Over Coffee.**](https://casesovercoffee.com)
6. [**Consulting Interview Prep.**](https://www.youtube.com/user/MConsultingPrep/playlists)
7. [**Consult Case Prep.**](https://www.youtube.com/user/firmsconsulting/playlists)
8. [**The Younger Me Project.**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7xmSTfYgi2eqIV_ABw-eXg) (Done with Aviral Bhatnagar's Session. He was saying everything that I belived in. Felt Happy)
9. GRE/CAT practice.
10. PhD Ideas.
11. Signals and Systems (FFT comes here. Also comes in Competitive Programming.)
------------------------
### **Hacks**
1. Getting up early.
2. Spending less time on "Youtube Surfing".
3. Focussing on the present i.e giving all in.
4. Eating Healthy.
------------------------
### **Mistakes**
0. Coming to Kudankulam + Not being serious about KVPY/NTSE/IMO etc. (Never ever prepared for it. Regret it to this date).
1. Not taking a drop year for JEE. (The regret of not going to JEE coaching is more than the regret of going to JEE coaching and not qualifying. (Just my personal opinion)).
2. Taking up Electrical Engineering. (AC/DC Machines, Power Systems, Power Electronics are of zero value to me).
3. Not taking enough risks at a early stage of life.
4. Not taking up CS/Coding early on. (Due to lack of resources/awareness).
5. Spending too much time on TV Shows during undergrad.
6. Not being well aware/informed during post grad.
