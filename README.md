 If observed carefully, this is exactly how "Simulated Annealing Algorithm" works. It's a famous "Placement Algorithm" used in VLSI Physical Design and the philosophy of this algorithm has been taken from "Physics/Thermodynamics".

2. Future of EDA? (My belief, as long as software exists, EDA will be present).
3. Clock Sink Point Clustering. Why is it such a big deal? Why have we not solved this well enough?

10. Compete in CodeForces Div 3 Contest ASAP.
11. [**ITMO CP course**](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2/lesson/2) (Probably the best free competitive programming course on the planet. Pashka is just phenomenal )
12. [**Coursera VLSI CAD Course**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/vlsi-cad-layout/supplement/Ytgkc/week-1-overview) (I figured this out recently. This is the best VLSI CAD course out there that is available for free. Man, these guys have Placement and Routing Visualisers etc. It's always been my dream to do work at this level.)
13. A project on Routing and Timing. (Tool Design and Development).
14. Solving problems on Binary Search. (It's very rewarding. I got to know a lot of concepts by solving problems).
15. Learn [**Linear & Integer Programming**](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Integer-Programming-Made-Easy-ebook/dp/B01F4TH310).
------------------------
### **Progress Tracking**
1. Bit Masking (Completed).
2. Math (Big Integers) (Going On).
3. I am unable to design a placement engine despite doing a complete course on it. I will have to investigate further. I need some help here from CAD researchers/CS Engineers.
4. VLSI CAD Course. (Completed)
5. Linked List Coding Problems on Binary Search. (Going On).
6. Non Linear Data Structures Practice (Going On).
7. JEE Math Lectures. (Going On)
8. Improve Aptitude/IQ.
9. Learn LaTeX.
------------------------
### **Observations**
1. Computer Science not only teaches you tech, it teaches you life.
2. The Universe is extremely non-linear. (80/20 Principle).
3. Entrance Coaching not only prepares for exams but hardens you. It improves your rigour in the subject matter.
4. Everybody runs after money, but nobody acknowledges it.
5. If you don't ask, the answer is always "No".
6. "20's" is all about figuring out what you want to do for the rest of your life.
7. Physical Design (Specifically P&R has little to no math required. All the math is present in PDN, STA, EDA, Analog Design, Memory Design, Architecture R&D). Also, people seem to solve **Bounded** problems in Physical Design.
8. ABK believes that performing experimental investigations is much more important than Algorithms. As a guy from a Pure Math & CS background, he can say that. I have not quite explored Algorithms area yet. I believe that EDA has more precedence and is tougher when compared to Physical Design. I found some really smart people who are in EDA.
9. The best and the most optimal way to approach EDA is through the Pure Math and Computer Science route rather than the Electrical Engineering Route. Eg. ABK, Thens etc.
10. I somehow have a feeling that **I** have enough know-how/knowledge as someone who is a 1st Yr. PhD from UCSD.
11. What Prastut does make a lot of sense. There is no definition for speed. i.e how fast you ought to go. B.Tech can be completed under 4 years. We end up wasting a lot of time. That is a different story.
12. In the end, you ought to do hard things. Only then, you're learning will be non-linear aka exponential. 
13. **[EDA > Design]** (In terms of difficulty. That explains the less no. of people in EDA). But **[Design > EDA]** in terms of money. Design Industry is much larger than EDA. However, People can switch from EDA to S/W easily and there is no comparison when it comes to the Software Industry.
14. I have observed this multiple times. I always get the toughest of the opponents/teams. 
For eg. During TT Championship -- I got the guy who won the cup.
Similarly, at work, I got the toughest team. GPU Team.
15. CS Undergrads from Brazil are designing Routing, DRC Engines and M.S students from NTU are coding **B+ Tree Based Floorplanning** for assignments. What am I even doing with my life? There is so much **gap** even at the academic level. There is no way India can catch upto that level. India will for-ever be an **Execution Center** and US/Taiwan/Europe/China will always have a giant lead. There will always be a 50-100 year gap between India and the developed countries. I have just seen **Thens** who has done some active contributions towards EDA. I am realising what **Sibi Kabilan** told 3 years back. The Qualcomms, Intels, nVidia's, AMD's of India are glorified **Body Shops/Service Centers** of the US counterparts.
16. Exams that are "worthy" of chasing in India -- JEE/CAT/UPSC/NEET & maybe CEED. "GATE" is actually a downgrade. (I did it because I wanted to reach '0' from -(INT_MAX) ). 
17. I tend to take things to my ego very fast. For eg. I didn't fare well in STA during my post grad times. However, I happened to have nailed STA when I entered the industry. Similarly, I was not so proficient in Programming, but later I spent a lot of time and cracked Research Intern at IIT-Madras.
18. "Brazil" is kicking ass in Physical Design EDA. It makes me wonder 'How does a developing country become so good at EDA/Algorithms?'.
19. Physical Design EDA Lobby is mostly manipulated by top researchers/businessmen. Surprisingly, a huge portion of the people belong to Asian and European ethnicity. (Specifically Taiwan, China, Russia, Swiss, Italy)

### **Mistakes**
0. Coming to Kudankulam + Not being serious about KVPY/NTSE/IMO etc. (Never ever prepared for it. Regret it to this date).
1. Not taking a drop year for JEE. (The regret of not going to JEE coaching is more than the regret of going to JEE coaching and not qualifying. (Just my personal opinion)).
2. Taking up Electrical Engineering. (AC/DC Machines, Power Systems, Power Electronics are of zero value to me).
3. Not taking enough risks at a early stage of life.
4. Not taking up CS/Coding early on. (Due to lack of resources/awareness).
5. Spending too much time on TV Shows during undergrad.

And as an after effect, it would've made their lives better by saving thousands of man-hours which otherwise would have been invested in researching. I managed to make this world a better place indirectly.
